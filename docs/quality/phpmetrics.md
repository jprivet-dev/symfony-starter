## About

PhpMetrics provides various metrics about PHP projects.

## Installation

I don't know why, but I've had this problem: : `composer require --dev phpmetrics/phpmetrics` add `"phpmetrics/phpmetrics": "^0.0.1"` in `composer.json`, and do not create `vendor/bin/phpmetrics`.

I need to force the version with the following command :

```
composer require --dev phpmetrics/phpmetrics:2.8.1 --with-all-dependencies
```
