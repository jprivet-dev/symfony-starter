# Validate certificates

[⬅️ README](../README.md)

This project uses HTTPS for local development, which requires handling self-signed TLS certificates generated by **Caddy**. Follow these steps to ensure your browser trusts the local development environment.

## 1. Add hostname to your hosts file

First, you need to add your project's hostname to your `/etc/hosts` file. This ensures that the URL `https://your-project.localhost:8443` resolves correctly.

* Run the following command:
  ```shell
  make hosts
  ```

This command automatically adds the `127.0.0.1` entry for your project's `SERVER_NAME` in your `hosts` file, if it doesn't already exist.

## 2. Trust the Caddy certificate

Next, install the **Caddy** root certificate into your system's trust store. This allows your operating system and browsers to automatically trust the certificate, avoiding security warnings.

* Run the following command:
  ```shell
  make certificates
  ```

This command automatically detects your operating system (**macOS** or **Linux**) and uses the appropriate system tools to add the certificate to your list of trusted authorities.

## 3. Export and manually import the certificate (if needed)

If the previous step doesn't work for your system or browser (e.g., Firefox), you can export the certificate and import it manually.

* Run the following command to export the certificate to the `tls` folder:
  ```shell
  make certificates_export
  ```

This will create a `tls/root.crt` file. You can then follow these steps to manually import the certificate into your browser:

* **For Chrome/Brave**: Go to `chrome://settings/certificates`, navigate to the "Authorities" tab, and import the `tls/root.crt` file.
* **For Firefox**: Go to `about:preferences#privacy`, click "View Certificates...", select the "Authorities" tab, and import the `tls/root.crt` file.
